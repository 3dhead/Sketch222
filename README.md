# Sketch
Art class web application that produces reference photos to sketch in a limited amount of time. Still WIP

Much like Pixelovely's application ( artists.pixelovely.com/practice-tools/figure-drawing/ ) with a few feature changes.

(Planned) Features:
-> A timer that can be visible/invisible. 
-> Photo tagging system
-> Multiple categories: figures, animals, clothing, hands/feet, landscapes and buildings(?)
-> Full screen option to minimize distractions 
-> Challenges (?)


Nice-to-haves
-> An option to upload your own reference photos (not sure about this yet)
